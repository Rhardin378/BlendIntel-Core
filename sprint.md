## üîß Technical Decisions

### Frontend Framework

- **Next.js 14** (App Router) - Already set up, keep consistency
- **React + TypeScript** - Type safety across stack
- **Tailwind CSS** - Fast styling, responsive utilities

### Audio Recording

- **MediaRecorder API** - Native browser support (Chrome, Safari)
- **Fallback strategy** - Show "Voice not supported" message on old browsers
- **Audio format** - WebM (Chrome) or MP3 (Safari) - handle both

### State Management

- **React useState** - Simple local state for now
- **No Redux needed** - Stateless search queries, no complex state
- **localStorage** - Optional search history persistence

### Deployment

- **Vercel** - Free tier, perfect for Next.js
- **Environment variables** - Already configured (OpenAI, Pinecone, Voyage)
- **HTTPS required** - For microphone access (Vercel provides by default)

---

## üìö Resources Needed

### Documentation

- [Whisper API Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text)
- [MediaRecorder API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder)
- [FDA Nutrition Label Guide](https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/how-understand-and-use-nutrition-facts-label)
- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

### Design Inspiration

- Smoothie King website (brand colors, fonts)
- MyFitnessPal (nutrition label examples)
- Modern voice UI patterns (Google Assistant, Siri)

---

## üö® Potential Blockers

1. **Browser microphone permissions** - Need to handle denials gracefully
2. **Audio format compatibility** - Safari vs Chrome differences
3. **Whisper API latency** - May be slower than expected (500-1000ms)
4. **Nutrition label spacing** - CSS precision required for FDA compliance

### Mitigation Strategies

- Test on multiple browsers early
- Add clear permission instructions
- Show loading indicators during transcription
- Use FDA reference image for pixel-perfect layout

---

## üìä Definition of Done (This Sprint)

A user can:

1. ‚úÖ Click the mic button and speak naturally
2. ‚úÖ See their spoken words transcribed
3. ‚úÖ View search results within 2 seconds
4. ‚úÖ Read a professional nutrition label for the top result
5. ‚úÖ See AI explanation of why this smoothie matches
6. ‚úÖ Access the site on mobile and desktop
7. ‚úÖ Type queries as an alternative to voice

**Demo-ready:** Record a 60-second video showing the full flow for portfolio/README.
